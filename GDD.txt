CONCERNS
Working on the same project at the same time - using branch control and merge functionality.
is it better to work at one location or use comms and work remotely

we should be able to have a working product by the end of the first effort? do we need to plan to achieve this (i.e. prebuild models, gather sound effects etc etc)
